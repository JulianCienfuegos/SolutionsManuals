Style Idea: Replicate the style of the algorithm design manual, if trivially possible.

Problem: Show that a+b can be less than min(a,b)
Solution: let a = -1, b = -1

Problem: Show that a x b can be less than min(a, b)
Solution: let a = b = \frac12

Problem: Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that the fastest route between a and b is not the shortest route.
Solution: learn a little latex graphics and draw a right triangle with speed limits marked on the edges. The legs have speed limit 80 mph, but the hypotenuse has speed limit 10mph. 

Problem: Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that the shortest route between a and b is not the route with the fewest turns.
Solution: See solution to problem 3.
